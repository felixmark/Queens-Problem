# Queens Problem
The Queens Problem is a task to find one or all solutions to place 8 queens on an 8 by 8 chess field.
I extended the task so solutions can also be found for smaller and bigger fields.
The program is written in C for Linux.
Slight changes have to be made to make it compilable for Windows.
